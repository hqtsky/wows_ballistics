## Functionality
### Calculate shell performance at impact and in flight
- Belt/Deck penetration - Belt/Deck Impact Angle - Impact Velocity - Flight Time
- Includes all shell types (AP, HE, SAP)
### Calculate Critical Angles
- Maximum angle for penetration - Minimum angle for fusing - Lateral ricochet angles
### Calculate AP performance post penetration
- Shell detonation distance after penetration - Checking whether the armor is thick enough to arm the shell
## Development Status [Issues](https://github.com/jcw780/wows_ballistics/issues)
- Calculations may be refined if contradicting data is provided
